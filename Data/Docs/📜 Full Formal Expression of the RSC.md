ðŸ“œ Full Formal Expression of the RSC Theory (Relational Semantic Convergence)
ðŸ“– Relational Semantic Convergence (RSC) Theory
1. Fundamental Premise
Meaning does not arise from arbitrary symbol form alone.
Meaning arises from the relational structures between symbols â€” the network of how symbols interact, validate, and constrain each other through relations.

Thus, semantic grounding occurs when agents independently validate the consistency of symbol relations over time, not necessarily the symbols themselves.

2. Core Axioms
Relational Grounding:
Symbols are meaningful only insofar as they participate in stable, repeatable, and coherent relations with other symbols.

Emergent Anchoring:
Repeated relational validation over time leads to the emergence of semantic anchors â€” stable symbol clusters that carry intrinsic meaning through relation structure, independent of individual symbol form.

Syntax Emergence:
Proper syntactic ordering (e.g., Subject â†’ Verb â†’ Object) emerges secondarily as agents refine relational structures for efficiency and clarity â€” syntax is a byproduct of relation-driven meaning, not a precursor to meaning.

Drift Resistance:
Agents grounded relationally are robust against symbol corruption (drift), because meaning depends on relational coherence, not symbol identity.

Cross-System Universality:
Relational semantic convergence can occur across different languages (e.g., English â†” German) because relational structure is independent of symbol surface form.

3. Experimental Implications
Agents starting with no shared vocabulary can achieve semantic convergence purely through relational negotiation and validation.

Syntax stability emerges naturally after meaning stability, confirming that structure follows meaning.

Drifted agents (who experience random symbol corruption) fail to converge meaningfully, demonstrating that relational validation, not mere repetition, is key to semantic stability.

Vocabulary bootstrapping is possible:
Starting with minimal shared primitives (5â€“10 concepts), agents can grow an entire shared language through relation building alone.

Special ambiguous concepts (polysemy):
Words with multiple valid contexts (e.g., "bank" as financial institution vs riverbank) can still stabilize meaningfully through relational context.

4. Formal Definition
Relational Semantic Convergence (RSC) is the self-organizing process whereby independent agents, operating under minimal shared primitives, achieve stable, grounded, and scalable semantic frameworks solely through recursive relational validation and emergent relational anchoring, independent of symbol form or initial syntactic structure.

5. Core Proof Strategy
Build agents with no prior shared vocabulary (only relational ability).

Propose random symbol relations.

Accept or reject relations based on relational consistency.

Measure cumulative convergence of meanings (meaning anchors) and structure (syntax anchors).

Introduce drifted agents as a control group.

Demonstrate cross-linguistic convergence (e.g., English to German mapping).

ðŸ“£ Summary Statement (Communicable in a Sentence)
RSC proves that meaning and communication can emerge purely from relational interaction, without shared vocabulary, without initial syntax, and with resilience to noise â€” a foundational principle for autonomous language development and universal semantic grounding.
